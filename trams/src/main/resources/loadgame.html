You can load a game in TraMS, by clicking on "Load Game" from the TraMS Welcome Screen or clicking File > Load Game from the menu bar. You will then be prompted to choose the location of the saved game as shown in the screen above. The file must have a .tms file extension. Click once on the name of the game and then click Open.<br/><br/>
If you see the message below when you load a TraMS saved game, please check that the game was saved in TraMS. If it was, it may have been an earlier version of TraMS. Please check the TraMS website at <a href="http://trams.davelee.me.uk">http://trams.davelee.me.uk</a> as a convertor may be available.</p>
