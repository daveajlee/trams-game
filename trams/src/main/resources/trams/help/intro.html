<h2 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to TraMS Help!</h2>
<p>Welcome to TraMS, a brand new transport management game, where you ensure that your own public transport company picks up passengers on-time. If your vehicles are delayed in traffic then you need to take action to get them back on schedule before your passengers get frustrated and leave for another transport operator. Can your transport operator stand the test of time or will your passengers take your company off the road/rails?</p>

<p>TraMS was originally developed by David A J Lee and is now open source software.</p>
