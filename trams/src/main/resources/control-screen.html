<h3>Vehicle Status</h3>
<p>TThe Control Screen (shown above) is the main screen within TraMS. From this screen, you can monitor the status of any vehicle currently running. To choose a route to monitor, click on that route from the list at the top of the screen. From here, you can also monitor the time. Remember your vehicles are more likely to run late during the morning and evening rush hours! Four route schedules are shown as triangles pointing in the direction that they are travelling with the stops on that route shown as columns. A red triangle indicates that the vehicle is running late whilst a green triangle indicates the vehicle is running to schedule. You can get more information on a route schedule by clicking on the triangle - see the "Vehicle Information Screen" help topic for more information. If the selected route has more than four route schedules, click on the "Next Vehicles" button to view the other route schedules.</p>

<h3>Changing Vehicles/Routes</h3>
<p>You can click on the Management tab to visit the Management Screen to make changes to any routes and purchase/sell vehicles. You can also click the Messages tab to read important messages. You should refer to the individual help topics if you need more information.</p>

<h3>Passenger Satisfaction</h3>
<p>Remember to watch your passenger satisfaction bar at the bottom! This will drop from 100% according to how many vehicles are currently running late. You may want to re-time your vehicles to increase passenger satisfaction. If it falls too low, you will be sacked!</p>

<h3>Pause Simulation</h3>
<p>You can pause the simulation at any time by clicking the "||" button. When you are ready to resume, click on the "|>" button. You can also speed up or slow down the simulation using the appropriate buttons.</p>
