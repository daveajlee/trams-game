<h3>Add Route</h3>
<p>From the Management Screen, you can click "Create Route" to create a new route. You need to enter the following information on the Create Route screen which appears:
<span style="font-style:italic;">Route Number:</span> You must enter a route number - this can either be a number (e.g. 1) or text (e.g. 1B).
<span style="font-style:italic;">Stops:</span> You may choose up to 5 stops which this route will serve by clicking on the down arrow and choosing from the pop-up list.
<span style="font-style:italic;">Route Timetable:</span> You must create 1 or more timetables for this route - each timetable has an exclusive period of validity.

Each timetable must have the following information:
<span style="font-style:italic;">Name:</span> Give a descriptive name for this timetable so that you will recognise it later.
<span style="font-style:italic;">Service Pattern(s):</span> You must create 1 or more service patterns for this route. Service patterns determine the frequency and hours of operation of the route on certain days.

Each service pattern must have the following information:
<span style="font-style:italic;">Name:</span> Give a descriptive name for this service pattern so that you will recognise it later.
<span style="font-style:italic;">Days of Operation:</span> Tick the box beside the days when this service will operate.
<span style="font-style:italic;">Between:</span> Choose the stops which the service will run between with this frequency.
<span style="font-style:italic;">From/To/Every:</span> Choose the times that the route will operate and the frequency it will operate at.

Once you have added at least one timetable and one service pattern, the "Create Route" button will be available. After clicking on the "Create Route" button, the route will be saved, and you will be returned to the Management Screen. If you wish to be returned to the Management Screen without saving, click on the "Return to Previous Screen" button.<br/><br/>
